# structured_imitation_demo
A demonstration of structured prediction algorithms using imitation learning for natural language processing

This is a library accompanied by a short jupyter notebook showcasing the Dataset Aggregation algorithm (DAgger) applied to PoS taging.
The code is written to be easy to adapt to other tasks of interest. To get started, clone/download the repo and run the jupyter notebook in ```src/POSdemo.py```
